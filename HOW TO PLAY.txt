KillMyself is a project made in Keimyung University in Daegu in South Korea.

The goal was to create a 3d action game using Unity3D and by team of 5.

Me and my team set on KillMyself, the story of a robot capsule who has to threw himself in a volcano.

To play make sure that Unity - Mid-Term - 7012769.exe and Unity - Mid-Term - 7012769_Data are in the same folder and double click Unity - Mid-Term - 7012769.exe

Enjoy!
